Our support will reply by sending you an invitation to the requested language. Please, Join TREZOR Wallet translation project in CrowdIn using the provided link and navigate to the requested language. The language in the example below is Czech.

3. Translate
------------

.. note:: We recommend to write down notes while translating so you know how you translated specific words and the translation stays consistent during the whole process. This comes really handy later as we can speak from our own experience. 

.. important:: In some languages might be an option to choose between "official" and "unofficial" way of speech. We do prefer the more official way.

Please start by translating Glossary. It is used later for consistency purpose. If Glossary is fully translated, move on to the Wallet translation.

Please translate each string as exactly as possible, but main point is to keep the **original meaning**. Following recommendations will help you to understand the original better and to work more efficiently:

* Use Context description and screenshots to understand the translated string better.
* Always check Terms tab (Glossary) to keep the translation consistent.
* Using automatic translations in Suggestions tab can speed up your work.

You will also find strings which contain placeholders and HTML tags. In that case copy the whole string and translate only things placed out of those placeholders (for example following string):

  <b>{{key}}</b> changed from <b>{{old}}</b> to <b>{{new}}</b>

Please translate the **changed from** and **to** only. Placement of these special strings in sentence does not matter as long as you keep them spelled properly. If your language does require some specific word sequence, you may shuffle them.

Please report any inconsistencies, unclarities or mistakes in the English language (source) or in the UI. 

* To report any particular issue or to suggest specific improvements, use the Comments tab during translation. 
* To report a general issue, please use the `Discussions panel. <https://crowdin.com/project/trezor-wallet/discussions>`_

In case of any issues, difficulties or questions please check the `CrowdIn Documentation <https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/>`_ or contact us via `Support <https://satoshilabs.kayako.com/conversation/new/2>`_
